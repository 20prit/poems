Title: The Tale of Jheel and the Kolkata Palace

Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Kolkata, lived a humble, sweet girl named Jheel. Jheel lived in a small, colorful house near the bustling Howrah Bridge, with her wicked stepmother and two cruel stepsisters. They treated Jheel like a servant, but she remained kind-hearted and cheerful, always hoping for better days.

One day, a royal proclamation was made throughout Kolkata. The Prince, Arjun, who was known for his bravery and kindness, was to host a grand ball at the magnificent Victoria Memorial. Every eligible maiden in Kolkata was invited, for the Prince was seeking a bride.

Jheel's heart fluttered with excitement, but her joy was short-lived. Her wicked stepmother laughed, "A royal ball is not a place for a ghar ki naukrani like you." Despite her sadness, Jheel kept her spirits high, helping her stepsisters prepare for the ball.

On the evening of the ball, as Jheel was watching her stepsisters leave, an old woman appeared. She was the renowned wise woman of Kolkata, known for her mystical powers. Touched by Jheel's kindness and humility, she decided to help. With a wave of her hand and a chant in Bangla, "Shakti dao, shundori hoye jao!" (Receive power, turn into a beauty!), Jheel was transformed. She was dressed in a radiant saree, her hair adorned with gajra, and her feet slipped into the most elegant pair of gold embroidered juttis.

The wise woman warned, "Remember, the magic will fade when the Howrah Bridge's lights turn off at midnight. You must return home before then."

Jheel arrived at the grand ball, and her beauty and grace captivated everyone, especially Prince Arjun. They danced and talked, losing track of time. Jheel found herself falling in love with the Prince's warm heart and gentle nature.

As they were engrossed in their conversation, the clock struck twelve. Remembering the wise woman's words, Jheel rushed out of the ballroom, leaving behind one of her juttis in her haste. Prince Arjun, who was smitten by her charm, picked up the jutti, vowing to find her.

The next day, the Prince and his men traveled across Kolkata, from the narrow lanes of Kumortuli to the colorful markets of New Market, seeking the owner of the jutti. Finally, they arrived at Jheel's house. Her stepsisters tried to force their feet into the jutti, but it was of no use.

Finally, Jheel was given a chance. As soon as she slipped her foot into the jutti, it fit perfectly. Overjoyed, Prince Arjun recognized her as the enchanting maiden from the ball. He proposed to Jheel, who blushed and accepted. The wicked stepmother and stepsisters were astonished, but they could say nothing.

Prince Arjun and Jheel got married in a grand wedding at the Princep Ghat, with the Hooghly River and the Vidyasagar Setu creating a magical backdrop. They lived happily ever after, filling the Kolkata Palace with laughter, love, and warmth.

And so, the tale of Jheel reminds us of an old Hindi proverb, "Sacchai ki raah chuno, kyunki sacchai ka rasta hamesha sahi hota hai." (Choose the path of truth, for the path of truth is always right.)
