With a heart so warm and a spirit so bright,
She brings light to the house, day and night.
Her love and protection, never to sway,
She's the elder sister, who leads the way.

She stands strong, with her head held high,
Her courage and strength, a guiding light.
She fights to protect, and rule with care,
Her love and guidance, always to share.

In moments of trouble, she's always near,
Her love and support, a source of cheer.
She brings peace to the household, with her grace,
Her kindness and wisdom, a smile on her face.

So here's to the elder sister, so kind,
A leader in the family, with a heart so fine.
May she always be surrounded by love,
And know how much she is appreciated, up above
