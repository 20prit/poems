Two sisters, hand in hand,
Walking through life's shifting sand.
Together they face each day,
With love, support, and laughter, they play.

One with hair as golden as the sun,
The other with locks as dark as night.
One with eyes as bright as stars,
The other with gaze as warm as light.

Their bond, unbreakable and true,
A friendship that forever grew.
They lift each other up so high,
And wipe away each other's teary eyes.

No matter what life may bring,
These sisters will always sing.
A song of love that will never fade,
A bond that can never be betrayed.

So here's to the two sisters, so dear,
May their bond forever be near.
May they always laugh and smile,
And walk life's journey, mile by mile.
