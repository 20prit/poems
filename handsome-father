Handsome and strong, a tower of grace,
A father whose smile lights up the place.
With eyes that twinkle and a heart of gold,
His presence warms every soul he holds.

He's a man of laughter, with a sense of humor,
A steady hand to guide us, with a heart so pure.
His wisdom and guidance guide us through life,
And with his love, we face every strife.

He's the one who picks us up when we fall,
And with a hug, makes us feel tall.
His love is unconditional, it's plain to see,
And with him by our side, we can be anything we want to be.

So here's to the handsome father, so kind,
A role model to all, with a heart so fine.
May he always be surrounded by love,
And know how much he is appreciated, up above.
