With a desire to help and heal,
To understand and make people feel.
I have the ambition, to become a psychologist,
To listen, guide and be the life-saver's fist.

To delve into the depths of the mind,
To unravel the mysteries that bind.
To help those in need, to find peace within,
And be the source of hope and healing, from within.

I'll use my skills, and my heart as well,
To provide comfort and guidance, to those who dwell.
In a world of pain and confusion, so wide,
I'll be the lighthouse, that guides with pride.

So here's to my ambition, to be a psychologist,
To help those in need, and be the bliss list.
May I always have the courage to heal,
And bring peace and hope, to those who feel.
