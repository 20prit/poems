In the kitchen, she stands with pride,
With utensils at hand, she'll never hide.
Her love for cooking, so pure and true,
Her meals, a treat for me and you.

Her pots and pans, she treats like gold,
Her spices and ingredients, never old.
She blends and mixes, with a master's touch,
Her creations, a feast, so much.

Her love to feed guests, always shining,
She'll cook with joy, never whining.
Straight as a cow, she stands so tall,
Her strength and grace, standing tall.

So here's to the mother, who loves to cook,
With a passion for food, she'll never forsake.
May she always be surrounded by love,
And know that her meals are a blessing from above.
